Iâ€™m a 3rd-year B.Tech CSE student with a strong passion for Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. I love building ML models, and creating practical projects that solve real-world problems.
On GitHub, I share my experiments and code to track my learning journey, collaborate with others, and continuously expand my skills in AI and Data Science. Always curious, I enjoy tackling challenges and turning ideas into working solutions.
